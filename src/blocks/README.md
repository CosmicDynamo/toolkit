A library of helpful data structures

##Cache
Adds the ability to store the retur from a function based on the single Hash (Sting | Object) key input to that function
~NOTE: This file was overriden during one of my git repo refactors.  actual functionality will need to be restored

##HashTable
Add functionality for looking up an Object by HashKey as well as looping through the items in the table
* Created to help avoid the possible indexing over.. type messages and the bulky safe code for doing just that

##Exception
A class for creating simple Exception objects with a message
* It is desired that at some point this wll help with errors over async code, but we shall see
