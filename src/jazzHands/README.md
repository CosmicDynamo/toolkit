====================

A library containing classes and features for interacting with RDF data

##Main Features:

###A SPARQL 1.1 Query Engine
* Created with mobile browser use in mind.  AMD and non generated to reduce downloaded code.
* Imported w3c Unit Test to validate a full featured engine (Once it is complete

###Turtle Syntax Parser
* Will hopefully reuse code from the SPARQL engine eventually.  Mobile First for the win

There was an implementation of the jsonld library at one time, but it was removed to avoid my having to maintain a 3rd party library
